# swave-test
A small study project on [swave][swave] by [Mathias Doenitz][doenitz].

# What is swave?
[swave][swave] is a lightweight Reactive-Streams infrastructure toolkit for Scala. It attempts to provide all the general-purpose stream construction, stream consumption and stream transformation logic that is typically required in applications that work with Reactive-Streams. Please hear from [Mathias][doenitz] himself from his talk on [Scalar Conf 2016 Swave - a fresh Reactive Streams Implementation][scalar-2016-swave]. The [slides][slides] are available [here][slides].

Have fun!
